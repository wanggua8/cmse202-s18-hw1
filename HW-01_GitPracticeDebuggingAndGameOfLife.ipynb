    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you're going to create a Git repository on GitHub so that you can track your progress on the assignment and preserve the final version that you turn in. In order to do this you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up a new *private* repository on https://github.com/ called \"cmse202-s18-hw1\".\n",
    "2. Add your Professor and your TA as collaborators with \"Read\" access to your repository so that we can see your assignment. For Section 001, you should add users \"devinsilvia\" and \"haoyunin\". For Section 002, you should add users \"yangy5\" and \"haoyunin\".\n",
    "3. Clone the repository on to your computer.\n",
    "4. Move this notebook into that newly cloned repository.\n",
    "5. Add the notebook file to your git repository.\n",
    "6. Commit the addition to your repository.\n",
    "7. Finally, to test that everything is working, \"git push\" the file so that it ends up in your GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything went as intended, the file should now show up on your GitHub account in the \"cmse202-hw1\" repository that you just created.  Periodically, you'll be asked to commit your changes to the repository and push them to the remote GitHub location. Of course, you can always commit your changes more often than that, if you wish.  It can be good to get into a habit of committing your changes any time you make a significant modification, or when you stop working on the project for a bit."

    "\n",
    "Some of you may heard of Conway's Game of Life and some of you may not have. Even if you haven't heard of it, it's possible that you've seen something like it before. For details regarding thie version of the \"Game of Life\", I encourage you to take a look at the Wikipedia entry [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) to get a bit of background.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conway's Game of Life is essentially a very simple agent-based model.  We'll be working more with agent-based models in the future that are more complex, so this should give you a basic sense of how one might work. Basically, the Game of Life defines a set of results that define whether or not any given cell in a grid of cells lives or dies. The rules are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Any living cell with less than two neighbors dies\n",
    "2. Any living cell with two or three neighbors lives to the next generation\n",
    "3. Any living cell with more than three neighbors dies\n",
    "4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the simple nature of this model, we can basically just use a collection of \"1\"s and \"0\"s to represent living and dead cells respectively. We can then set up a two-dimensional grid of cells that represent out initial population. We consider the Game of Life a \"zero player\" game because once the initial conditions are set, the population evolves itself based on the rules above. In some case the entire grid might die off, or in other you might end up with persistent populations that oscillate, or even some populations that move across the board (sometimes called \"gliders\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**Homework Task 3**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to write a program that initializes a 10x10 grid of cells and then evolves the cells for a minimum of 10 iterations (you can run it for more, but don't get too carried away!). You should build your program such that it outputs the initial state and end state into the notebook, but you should also save the files to your respository using the <code>savefig()</code> function in <code>matplotlib</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that your code is working, start off by initializing a grid that matches Figure 1 below and then confirm that when you run your code for ten steps, it matches the end state in Figure 2. You can also use these images as a guide for how you might want to style your plots. Plots with traditional axes don't really make sense for something like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you can reproduce the results, try starting with new initial configurations and see what sort of evolution you get. Include your favorite version in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your code in the cell below the figures!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extra goal**: Be careful that you don't generate too many files, but if you're feeling ambitious, I encourage you to try generating an image for each iteration and then creating an animation of your evolving system -- this is *not required* for the assignment. In order to make the animation, you might have to do a bit of googling to figure out how animations work either within a notebook, or by processing the image files you create."
